# Extended JAIN SLEE JAVAEE

> The Extended JAIN SLEE JAVAEE is an enhanced version derived from the JAIN SLEE project available at [https://github.com/RestComm/jain-slee.javaee](https://github.com/RestComm/jain-slee.javaee). We've introduced a series of improvements to enhance its capabilities.

## Key Features
* Empowers applications to communicate with legacy communications systems.
* Facilitates asynchronous execution of statements within the RA runtime resources.
* Relieves the JAIN SLEE Event Router from resource-blocking interactions with Datasources.
* Delivers results to applications through JAIN SLEE events.
* Eliminates the need for JAIN SLEE applications to manage connection closures, streamlining development and maintenance.
