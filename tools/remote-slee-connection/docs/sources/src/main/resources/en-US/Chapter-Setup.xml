				    <title>Downloading the source code</title>
				    <important>
				    	<para>Git is used to manage Restcomm JAIN SLEE source code. Instructions for downloading, installing and using Git can be found at <ulink url="http://git-scm.com/" /></para>
				    </important>
				    <para>Use Git to checkout a specific release source, the Git repository URL is https://github.com/RestComm/jain-slee.javaee/ , then switch to the specific release version, lets consider &THIS.VERSION;.</para>
				    <programlisting>
				    [usr]$ git clone https://github.com/RestComm/jain-slee.javaee restcomm-jain-slee-javaee
				    [usr]$ cd restcomm-jain-slee-javaee
				    [usr]$ git checkout tags/&THIS.VERSION;

				<step>
				    <title>Building the source code</title>
				    <important>
				    	<para>Maven 2.0.9 (or higher) is used to build the release. Instructions for using Maven2, including install, can be found at <ulink url="http://maven.apache.org" /></para>
				    </important>
				    <para>Use Maven to build the deployable unit binary.</para>
				    <programlisting>
					[usr]$ cd tools/remote-slee-connection
					[usr]$ mvn install
				    </programlisting>
				    <para>Once the process finishes you should have the <literal>JCA</literal> restcomm-slee-remote-connection.rar directory artifact in the <filename>target/restcomm-slee-remote-connection.rar-beans</filename> directory. Deploying the JCA connector depends on the Java EE platform used, in case of &JEE.PLATFORM; simply copy the directory artifact to the platform's deploy directory.</para>

			<para>Similar process as for <xref linkend="release_source_building"/>, the only change is the Git reference should be the <literal>master</literal>. The <literal>git checkout tags/&THIS.VERSION;</literal> command should not be performed. If already performed, the following should be used in order to switch back to the master:</para>
