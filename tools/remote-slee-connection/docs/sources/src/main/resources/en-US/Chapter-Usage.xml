		<para>The only configuration needed is setting up the address of the JAIN SLEE container to interact, this is done through the config-property named SleeJndiName inside <filename>slee-ds.xml</filename> file inside the rar archive or directory. ${jboss.bind.address} should be replaced with the hostname used by the JAIN SLEE container.</para>
